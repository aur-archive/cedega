GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright © 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place,
 Suite 330, Boston, MA	02111-1307  USA Everyone is permitted to copy and
 distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
 not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.	It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
version number 2.1.]

Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
  share and change it.	By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
  intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
  make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
  designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
  Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too,
  but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or
  the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any
  particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in
  new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or
  for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object
  files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library
  after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must
  show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
  and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to
  copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
  is no warranty for the free library.	Also, if the library is modified
  by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they
  have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation
  will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any
  free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively
  restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license
  from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license
  obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full
  freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
  GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public
  License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different
  from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain
  libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
  shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined
  work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public
  License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination
  fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits
  more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does
  Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.
  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage
  over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason
  we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However,
  the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage
  the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a
  de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed
  to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does
  the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there
  is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only,
  so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
  enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.
  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs
  enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well
  as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked
  with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
  using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on
  the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The former contains
  code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with
  the library in order to run.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
  which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
  Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
  "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared
  so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some
  of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
  has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the Library"
  means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:
  that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either
  verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into
  another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
  in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
  modifications to it.	For a library, complete source code means all the
  source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
  definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
  installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.	The act of running
  a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
  program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
  Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).
  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program
  that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
  that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and
  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,and you
  may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
  thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
  modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that
  you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
    all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
    facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,
    then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
    application does not supply such function or table, the facility still
    operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
    purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.
    Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function
    or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
    not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that
  they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead
  of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary
  GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version
  instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
  copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent
  copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
  Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
  it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
  corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
  for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from
  a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
  code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
  source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
  source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
  but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with
  it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a work, in isolation,
  is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the
  scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates
  an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
  portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".
  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states
  terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that
  is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative
  work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this
  is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the
  Library, or if the work is itself a library.	The threshold for this to
  be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
  layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions
  (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
  unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.
  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library
  will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
  the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
  containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
  linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
  "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing
  portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your
  choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
  customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library
  is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution
  displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the
  Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy
  of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in
    the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);
    and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the
    complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
    and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then
    relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.
    (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions
    files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the
    application to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
    A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the
    library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
    copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
    properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs
    one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the
    version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
    above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from
    a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
    materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials
    or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library"
  must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
  executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to
  be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
  (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
  kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
  other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
  system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
  Library together in an executable that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
  side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities
  not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
  provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library
  and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided
  that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
    the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.	This must
    be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
    of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
  Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
  is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
  License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
  remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
  it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
  Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you
  do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
  Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance
  of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
  licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions
  on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
  responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute
  so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
  and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
  distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would
  not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
  receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
  could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
  distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.
Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
  countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
  copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
  explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
  written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
  will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
  to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.	If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write
  to the author to ask for permission.	For software which is copyrighted
  by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
  we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by
  the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
  FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
  PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK
  AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
  LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING
  BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
  LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO
  OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS
  BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
